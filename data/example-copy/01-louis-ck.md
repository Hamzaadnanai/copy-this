## Louis CK’s “Live at the Video Store” Sales Page

I developed and prepared this material over the last year or so,
mostly in comedy clubs. 

This special kind of goes back to when I used to just make noises
and be funny for no particular reason. It felt right to shoot this
special in a club to give it that live immediate intimate feeling. 

The show is about an hour long. 

The opening act, who is seen at the beginning (good place for an
opening act) is Jay London. 

One of my favorite club comics going way back to the late 80s
when I first started in working in New York.

I hope you like it.

*Please PLEASE don’t torrent this special.* 

If you want to share it, direct people here. It’s so easy to drop the 5
dollars. We don’t make you join anything. We let you use the file any
way you want. It costs a shitload of money to make these specials
and I do it myself. I love offering it to you directly for so cheap and
so easily. I would like that to continue to be a good idea.

Okay. Enjoy the show.

Also, this is the first show I'm offering in 1080p HD. The video is
H.264 and the audio is MP3 or FLAC. Both are available for stream
or download.

The cost is $5.00.

To buy this thing, do this: Enter your email (We will NOT bother you)

Then you can watch the show, download the show, ignore the show.
Whatever you want. After that, you never, ever have to hear from me
again. Unless you want to.
