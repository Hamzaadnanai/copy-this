“Marie is one of the most knowledgeable Notion users in the world”

Ivan Zhao, CEO + Founder of Notion


You’ve gone down the Notion rabbit-hole but quickly got
overwhelmed. You binge-watched how-to videos on YouTube for
hours instead of writing those blog posts you had planned.


You see the potential of this powerful, all-in-one productivity tool,
but don’t know how to fully harness it.


Maybe you tried loading some of the pre-made templates into your
account, and got frustrated because they re not useful enough on
their own. They re not part of a bigger more integrated system.


Templates ≠ A System


Any of these sound familiar?

 You feel scattered across a ton of different tools and tech

 Things often feel like they re falling through the cracks

 Your Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote or local files are a mess

 You waste a ton of time trying to remember where you’ve saved
your files

 You feel overwhelmed, like you can t keep up with your obligations

 You don t have a consistent system for saving files, or tracking
your tasks

 You don t have standard documentation or templates

 You make lists of goals and ideas at the beginning of the year…
that you never revisit again


If you find yourself feeling scattered and spread across different
tools, platforms, apps, and paper planners…


I promise, there is a better way.


Notion offers you a way to integrate all of your tasks, documents,
activities, habits, ideas, and creativity in one place.


It s the most versatile and customizable platform for personal and
professional organization + productivity, and the one I use to run
every area of my life and business:


HOWEVER!!

If you don t already have well established systems, processes, and
routines, you’ll simply recreate the same dysfunctional patterns
from your old tools within Notion.


You’ve got to design your system in order for Notion to truly shine.



That s why I created Notion Mastery


Since 2018 I’ve been consulting with individuals and business
owners, helping them use Notion to create their life and business
operating systems and workflows.


I’ve seen the most common challenges, hiccups, and missing
pieces that most entrepreneurs and teams struggle with when
trying to streamline their operations.


I’ve condensed my best practices and workflows into a robust
online course and community to support you through the process
of going from scattered to streamlined with Notion.


Let me show you what is possible with this incredible tool!


If you’re ready to stop procrasti-planning and playing whac-amole with your to-do list, join me in Notion Mastery.


Hey, I’m Marie!


Back in 2017 I tried Notion for the first time, and it didn t quite
“click”. I knew it had potential, but wasn’t sure how to harness it.


It wasn t until I decided to try using Notion to help me plan my
Permaculture diploma (a messy, long term project requiring lots of
documentation, resources, imagery, notes, and both short + long
term planning) that I began to see what was possible, and why this
tool was so incredible.


As a die-hard (paid) Evernote + Asana + Dropbox + Google Drive
user, I was frustrated that my planning, tasks, files, and resources
felt disconnected and fragmented.


I knew Asana wasn t great for high-level thinking and ideation, and
Evernote wasn t great for task management…


I took a chance and moved all of my processes, tasks, resources,
and documentation over to Notion, and it was a complete gamechanger. I was finally able to build a system that worked for my
brain.


I could finally visualize all my work and commitments and got a grip
on where my time and effort was going (compared to where I
thought it was going).


In 2021 I was diagnosed with ADHD, and I began to finally
understand even more deeply why Notion was truly a life-changing
tool for me.


I was so smitten with the tool, I shared it with everyone who would
listen… and the rest is history.


Notion is the only tool I’ve found that has truly enabled
me to bridge the gap between bigger long-term goals
and day-to-day actions, all in one beautiful and
functional space.


Let me show you how to get the most out of it!
