HEY Homepage
Hey everyone–


I’m Jason, CEO here at Basecamp.


Email gets a bad rap, but it shouldn’t. Email’s a treasure.


It feels great to get an email from someone you care about. Or a
newsletter you enjoy. Or an update from a service you like. That’s
how email used to feel all the time.


But things changed.


You started getting stuff you didn’t want from people you didn’t
know. You lost control over who could reach you. An avalanche of
automated emails cluttered everything up.


And Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and Apple just let it happen.


Now email feels like a chore, rather than a joy. Something you fall
behind on. Something you clear out, not cherish. Rather than delight
in it, you deal with it.


And yet, email remains a wonder. Thanks to email, people across
cultures, continents, countries, cities, and communities
communicate every day. It’s reliable. It’s simple. It makes it easy for
two humans to share their love, and for millions of people to earn a
living.


So good news, the magic’s still there. It’s just obscured — buried
under a mess of bad habits and neglect. Some from people, some
from machines, a lot from email software.


Email deserves a dust off. A renovation. Modernized for the way we
email today.


With HEY, we’ve done just that. It’s a redo, a rethink, a simplified,
potent reintroduction of email. A fresh start, the way it should be.


HEY is our love letter to email, and we’re sending it to you on the
Web, Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android
