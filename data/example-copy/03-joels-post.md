Joel’s Blog Post: 12 Steps to
Better Code
Have you ever heard of SEMA [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/sema/
welcome.html]? It’s a fairly esoteric system for measuring how
good a software team is. 


No, wait! Don’t follow that link! It will take you about six years just to
understand that stuff. 


So I’ve come up with my own, highly irresponsible, sloppy test to
rate the quality of a software team. 


The great part about it is that it takes about 3 minutes. With all the
time you save, you can go to medical school.


The neat thing about The Joel Test is that it’s easy to get a
quick yes or no to each question. 


You don’t have to figure out lines-of-code-per-day or average-bugsper-inflection-point. 


Give your team 1 point for each “yes” answer. 


The bummer about The Joel Test is that you *really shouldn’t* use it
to make sure that your nuclear power plant software is safe.


A score of 12 is perfect, 11 is tolerable, but 10 or lower and you’ve
got serious problems. The truth is that most software organizations
are running with a score of 2 or 3, and they need *serious* help,
because companies like Microsoft run at 12 full-time.


Of course, these are not the only factors that determine success or
failure: in particular, if you have a great software team working on a
product that nobody wants, well, people aren’t going to want it. 


And it’s possible to imagine a team of “gunslingers” that doesn’t do
any of this stuff that still manages to produce incredible software
that changes the world. 


But, all else being equal, if you get these 12 things right, you’ll have
a disciplined team that can consistently deliver.




The rest of the post, which you should read, is a 12 point list that’s
all about tech - so no need to copy.


But that’s the desire section. What you just read was a great way to
create slippery slope as well as the attention and interest - part of
AIDA.


This could have been summed up in 1-2 sentences. 


But Joel does a perfect job of building hype to get you reading
more.


Keep in mind - this doesn’t mean use long when you can use short.
You should use the least amount of words needed to achieve your
goal.


And in this case, Joel used the perfect amount to get me to keep
reading.
