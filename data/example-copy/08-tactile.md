Tactile Turn About Us Page
Meet Will Hodges.


Will’s job is pretty simple. He makes pens out of high-quality
machined materials that all come with a lifetime warranty, just in
case.


But why pens?


Because everybody needs one. And Will believes that everyday
people deserve to use something beautiful, thoughtfully-designed,
and well-made every single day.


Will started Tactile Turn in 2012 in the outskirts of Dallas, TX,
because he was frustrated; frustrated with how disconnected we
are from the things we buy and how they’re made; frustrated that
high-quality, small-scale manufacturing has become so
inaccessible to the average person.


So, he took things into his own hands and bought an old, WWII-era
lathe, rented 160ft² in the corner of a friend’s workshop and made
his first 1,000 pens by hand.


Since then, a few things have changed...


Will has a new 9,000ft² workshop, state-of-the-art machines, and a
small, but mighty team of machinists manning them around the
clock, Monday through Friday.


All of Tactile Turn’s goods are still hand-machined in Garland, Texas
and Will is still obsessed with making things that will last a lifetime.


It’s not rocket science (although they do have an aerospace
engineer on staff). Tactile Turn’s writing instruments are for people
who are tired of buying overpriced plastic junk. It’s for people who
sweat the small stuff, yet stay remarkably cool under pressure. It’s
for people who measure twice and cut once, and who aren’t afraid
to get their hands (and shirts, and pants) dirty when something
goes wrong.


It’s for people like Will. And anyone who appreciates a job well
done. Shop Tactile Turn’s current catalog and follow along on
Instagram to see what the crew is up to.
