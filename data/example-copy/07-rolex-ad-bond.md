Rolex ad 3: James Bond
We invented the Submariner to work perfectly 660 feet under the
sea.


It seems to work pretty well at any level. 


The Rolex Submariner is a salty watch. It’s the official watch for
diverse of the Royal Navy. That beefed-up Oyster case resists
pressures down to 660 feet. You’ll find it in the cockpits of most
ocean racers as hard-driving skippers beat down to Bermuda,
Hobart and the Fastnet Rock.


How come it’s seen so much where the wettest thing around is a
dry Martini? Who knows. Maybe it’s because the black dial goes so
well with a black tie. Ask her. Maybe she knows.

When a man has a world in his hands, you expect to find a Rolex on
his wrist.
