## Stephen King’s Toolbox

The timid fellow writes “The meeting will be held at seven o’clock”
because that somehow says to him, 

“Put it this way and people will believe you really know.” 


Purge this quisling thought! 


Don’t be a muggle! Throw back your shoulders, stick out your chin,
and put that meeting in charge! Write The meeting’s at seven.


There, by God! Don’t you feel better?


I won’t say there’s no place for the passive tense. Suppose, for
instance, a fellow dies in the kitchen but ends up somewhere else. 


“The body was carried from the kitchen and placed on the parlor
sofa” is a fair way to put this, although “was carried” and “was
placed” still irk the shit out of me. 


I accept them but I don’t embrace them. 


What I would embrace is “Freddy and Myra carried the body out of
the kitchen and laid it on the parlor sofa.” 


Why does the body have to be the subject of the sentence, anyway?
It’s dead, for Christ’s sake! Fuhgeddaboudit!


Two pages of the passive voice—just about any business document
ever written, in other words, not to mention reams of bad fiction—
make me want to scream. 


It’s weak, it’s circuitous, and it’s frequently tortuous, as well. 


How about this: “My first kiss will always be recalled by me as how
my romance with Shayna was begun.”


Oh, man—who farted, right? 


A simpler way to express this idea—sweeter and more forceful, as
well—might be this: “My romance with Shayna began with our first
kiss. I’ll never forget it.”


I’m not in love with this because it uses with twice in four words,
but at least we’re out of that awful passive voice. 


You might also notice how much simpler the thought is to
understand when it’s broken up into two thoughts. 


This makes matters easier for the reader, and the reader must
always be your main concern; without Constant Reader, you are just
a voice quacking in the void. 


And it’s no walk in the park being the guy on the receiving end. 


“[Will Strunk] felt the reader was in serious trouble most of the
time,” E. B. White writes in his introduction to The Elements of Style,
“a man floundering in a swamp, and that it was the duty of anyone
trying to write English to drain this swamp quickly and get his man
up on dry ground, or at least throw him a rope.”


And remember: “The writer threw the rope,” not “The rope

was thrown by the writer.” Please oh please.


The other piece of advice I want to give you before moving on to the
next level of the toolbox is this: The adverb is not your friend.


Adverbs, you will remember from your own version of Business
English, are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
They’re the ones that usually end in -ly.


Adverbs, like the passive voice, seem to have been created

with the timid writer in mind. 


With the passive voice, the writer usually expresses fear of not
being taken seriously; it is the voice of little boys wearing
shoepolish mustaches and little girls clumping around in Mommy’s
high heels. 


With adverbs, the writer usually tells us he or she is afraid he/she
isn’t expressing himself/herself clearly, that he or she is not getting
the point or the picture across
