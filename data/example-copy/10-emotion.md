Hint advertorial by The Hustle
Getting called “Sweetie” Helped this Entrepreneur
Create a Multi-Million-Dollar Business


“Sweetie,” the executive said. “And I just dropped the
phone for a minute.”


Last week at Pizza & 40s, Kara Goldin, the founder
of Hint, told a story that fired me up.


The setup goes like this:


In 2004, Kara Goldin was drinking 10 Diet Cokes a day,
had bad acne, and was tired all the time. Wanting to
change her diet while also not giving up her love of
tasty beverages, she started making her own water by
boiling fruit skins and mixing the oils with water. She
called her concoction Hint.


However, six months after launching Hint, Goldin was
ready to quit.


Although sales were growing and Hint was being sold
in stores across the Bay Area, she was struggling to
figure out the shelf life of the beverage. Obviously,
understanding when your product needs to sell by is
not only important to the business, but to the
customer’s health… aka it’s a big deal.


And because Goldin – who had never worked in the
food industry before – launched Hint on the premise
that Americans deserve a natural, low-sugar beverage,
she wasn’t willing to use the easy fix that most
beverage brands use: preservatives.


Worried that she couldn’t scale the company, Goldin
called a Coke executive who she was hoping would
take over the company.


“Listen, I’m in San Francisco. I’ve never done beverages
before. I worked in tech and you can just have this
company. I launched it, we’re in 10 markets around the
Bay Area, and it’s doing pretty well.”


But then, the Coke exec interrupted her.


“Sweetie,” the executive said. “Americans love sweet.”


“And I was like… did he just call me sweetie?” Kara
said. “I just put the phone down and lost him for five
minutes. And then finally, a light bulb went off. He really
thinks Americans love sweet.”


“And so,” Goldin said, “I have runway to go and launch
this company because he’s not focused on a company
with no sweeteners.”


This conversation inspired Goldin. Now, 17 years later,
Hint Water is doing more than $100 million dollars a
year in sales. And companies like Apple, Facebook, and
LinkedIn stock their fridges with Hint’s variety pack of
flavors.


Note: The Hustle team tried all the flavors in the variety
pack and watermelon is our favorite.


Funny enough, 18 months after this conversation with
the Coke exec, Kara was told by a friend that Hint was
not only on Coke’s radar, but was listed on a slideshow
during a Coke meeting on potential competitors. “We
can’t let Hint get to the point of VitaminWater,” the slide
read.


VitaminWater was purchased by Coke for $4.8B.


Listen to your naysayers… not because they’re right,
but because it’s fuel.
