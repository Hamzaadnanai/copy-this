The Hustle Welcome Email
A letter from the leader of the circus, aka The Hustle:


I assure you, we don’t take what just happened lightly.


You just gave us your email and joined our newsletter.


That’s a VERY big deal to us.


Don’t believe me?


After you pressed the submit button and set us your email a little
buzzer went off in our office. Our entire team can hear it, and when
it went off everyone smiled.


Our office manager gave a golf clap and our operations guy did a
pushup (I don’t know why, but for some reason he does a pushup
each time the buzzer goes off).


Greg, our head of marketing, ran outside and hugged some old lady
walking by the office. I’m pretty sure he just tried to kiss her. She
didn’t seem to mind it, thankfully.


I’m also fairly certain I just saw Kera, our director of content, take a
shot of tequila. I have no idea why she’s drinking at work, but hey,
the kid is excited you just signed up. Is she pouring another one? Ah
crap, I gotta go and stop her.


Wait, shoot...I’m getting off topic. 


Look, I didn’t write this to tell you about our team’s awful impulse
control, but to thank you for signing up. Every pixel and character of
copy on our site and in this newsletter is here to make you happy. 


We hope every piece of content we create will inspire you to live a
more epic life. If it doesn’t, just hit reply to any email you receive
from The Hustle and tell us how you feel.


Thanks again for joining our tribe. We’ll holler at you soon with
some awesome stuff.
