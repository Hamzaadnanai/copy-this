Rolex ad 2: The Matterhorn
We built the Rolex Explorer because there isn’t any watch repair
shop on top of the Matterhorn.


This is the watch we engineered for the lonely places.


We carve its case out of a single block of Swedish steel so there
are no seams to come apart.


We test it at minus 50° and plus 150°F. We subject it to an
underwater pressure of 330 feet.


We then have an official Swiss Institute for Chronometer Tests
double-check the accuracy of its 26-jewel movement for 15 days
and 15 nights.


If it passes, the institute gives it a certificate guaranteeing
“especially good results.”


Then, and only then, do we sell it.


The Explorer sells for $180 (with authentic Rolex bracelet, $195) at
fine jewelry shops. Other waterproof, self-winding chronometers
from $175.
