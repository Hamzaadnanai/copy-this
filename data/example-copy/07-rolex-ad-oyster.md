Rolex ad 1: The Oyster Case
Next time somebody tells you they have an amazing, new
waterproof watch...


tell them about the crushed Oyster.


We dropped a standard Rolex Oyster case into a pressure tank.


Then we took the pressure down to 1,000 feet to see what
happened. 


Nothing happened. 


Then we went down to 1,500 feet. And nothing happened. At 1,700
feet the crystal began to bend a bit. 


And at 1,900 feet the back showed signs of bending. 


At 2,000 feet the crystal and the back bent severely. And if there
had been a movement inside it would have been crushed. But it
wouldnâ€™t have been wet. The Oyster case was still watertight.
