The Wall Street Journal Letter
Dear Reader:


On a beautiful late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, two

young men graduated from the same college. They were very much

alike, these two young men. Both had been better than average

students, both were personable and both — as young college
graduates are — were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.


Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th

reunion.


They were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both
had three children. And both, it turned out, had gone to work for the

same Midwestern manufacturing company after graduation, and
were still there.


But there was a difference. 


One of the men was manager of a small department of that
company. The other was its president.


What Made The Difference


Have you ever wondered, as I have, what makes this kind of
difference in people's lives? It isn't a native intelligence or talent or
dedication. It isn't that one person wants success and the

other doesn't.


The difference lies in what each person knows and how he or she
makes use of that knowledge.


And that is why I am writing to you and to people like you about The

Wall Street Journal. For that is the whole purpose of The Journal: to
give its readers knowledge — knowledge that they can use in

business.


A Publication Unlike Any Other


You see, The Wall Street Journal is a unique publication. It's the

country's only national business daily. Each business day, it is put

together by the world's largest staff of business-news experts.


Each business day, The Journal's pages include a broad range of

information of interest and significance to business-minded people,

no matter where it comes from. Not just stocks and finance, but

anything and everything in the whole, fast-moving world of

business... The Wall Street Journal gives you all the business news

you need — when you need it.


Knowledge Is Power


Right now, I am looking at page one of The Journal, the best-read

front page in America. It combines all the important news of the
day with in-depth feature reporting. Every phase of business news
is covered. I see articles on new inflation, wholesale prices, car

prices, tax incentives for industries to major developments in

Washington, and elsewhere.


And there is page after page inside The Journal, filled with

fascinating and significant information that's useful to you. The

Marketplace section gives you insights into how consumers are

thinking and spending. How companies compete for market share.
There is daily coverage of law, technology, media and marketing.
Plus daily features on the challenges of managing smaller
companies. The Journal is also the single best source for news and
statistics about your money. In the Money & Investing section there
are helpful charts, easy-to-scan market quotations, plus “Abreast of
the Market,” “Heard on the Street” and “Your Money Matters,” three
of America's most influential and carefully read investment
columns. If you have never read The Wall Street Journal, you cannot
imagine how useful it can be to you.


Much of the information that appears in The Journal appears
nowhere else. The Journal is printed in numerous plants across the
United States, so that you get it early each business day.
