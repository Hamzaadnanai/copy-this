The Gary Halbert AIDA Letter
Wedneday, 909 AM

June 27, 194


Dear Bond,


AIDA. As I said yesterday, it stands for attention, interest, desire,
and action.


Now, let’s talk about each of the four formula elements and how
we will use them in our sales letter.


Attention comesfirst. Naturally, we must get our readers
attention before he can become intereted in and deirou of our
offer. Getting attention i CRUCIAL. If you don’t get it, your letter or
advertiement will never be read. That’ why I like to attach thing
to the top of my DM letter. I have attached coin, dollar bill, 2-
dollar bill, Japanee “pennie”, Mexican peo etc. and thoe
gimmick ha alway gotten a lot of attention.


However, a I told you before, you mut get the right kind of
attention. If not, your reader will be inulted and angry and probably
won’t become a cutomer. So, alway remember that your attention
grabber need to be relevant. It need to tie in naturally with your
letter.


Now, a we have dicued, we have decided to attach a platic
baggie filled with and to the letter we are going to ue to ell our
report on real etate inveting.


There’ no doubt that thi technique will get our reader’ attention.
It will really make him it up and take notice. It will be the right kind
of attention too. Becaue it i relevant. It ha a natural tie in with
the tory our letter ha to tell. Actually, we have, a you will recall,
more or le written thi part of the letter in an earlier leon.


OK now, we have got attention and our firt few paragraph have
made a natural tie in with our “attention grabber.” So, what’ next?
Well, referring right back to our AIDA formula we ee that the next
thing we need to do (after getting hi attention) i catch hi
interet.


How do we do thi? Well, let’ tart by feeding him intereting fact.
Like how much money there i to be made by inveting in Maui real
etate. By telling how much and (cubic ton) i on the beach
where we got the and in that baggie. By telling how thi i one of
the bet beach front invetment opportunitie in Maui. By telling
how many pretty girl there are around. By telling the pecific kind
of fih you can catch right off the beach etc.


OK, now after we have told him a lot of intereting fact our AIDA
formula now tell u we hould now aroue hi deire.


Well, Bondo Dog, thing get curiouer and curiouer. I jut got fired
from my job. I’ll tell you the tory when you viit; there’ really not
much to ay and it’ kind of boring o let’ get back to our letter.


So, meanwhile back at the ranch I believe we were talking about
how to create deire and, a I wa aying, here’ how we do that
What we do to create deire i we decribe the benefit our
propect get if he buy our product or ervice. Now, in the cae of
an invetment orientated offer what we have to offer i the
propect of making money. At leat thi i our main attraction. So,
whatb letb do i let’ help him to picture in hi mind the benefit of
having more money. Don’t think it’ not neceary. Remember, you
mut alway do even the obviou. Here then, are ome benefit of
having more money
a New car - impre your friend and family, ride in comfort and
luxur
a Nice houe - comfort, luxury, and tatu
a eace of mind - no worrie about bill or financial emergencie
a Vacation - money let you travel the world, go where you want
when you wan
a Attract the oppoite ex - money, a any fool know, make you
much more attractive to the oppoite ex - it give you more
opportunitie to meet them in nice place al
a Leiure time - money buy time perhap the bet reaon of all
for having fun goes


Alright kiddo, we’ve got hi attention, we’ve got him intereted,
created deire and now what’ left? Go back to our AIDA formula
and you will ee that that lat “A” tand for action. And that’ jut
what we’ve got to get, action! Action in the form of him ending u
an order.


You hould pay very cloe attention to how I get action in my MD
and DM pitche. I do thi better than anybody. I am very thorough
when it come to cloing a ale. Here’ a little of example of how I
do it. “Would you like to get in on thi great invetment opportunity?
Would you like to be one of the privileged few who actually own a
piece of the finet beach in Maui? If o, it’ eay to order. All you
have to do i fill out the order coupon and end it to me with your
payment, etc., etc.”


One thing I want to tre i that you mut be very clear, very
pecific about what you want him to do. Lead him by the hand and
take him exactly where you want him to go. Tell him where the order
coupon i. Tell him to fill it out. Tell him to encloe the payment. Tell
him how much to end. Tell him who the check and money order
hould be made out to. Tell him to ue the envelope. Tell him the
envelope doenbt need a tamp. (If it doen’t.) Tell him to put the
envelope in the mail.


And, above all, tell him to do all thi RIGHT NOW! TODAY!


Tell him what he will get if he hurrie and tell him what he will loe if
he delay.


Seriouly, Bond, you hould read my ad and DM piece and pay
particular attention to how I cloe the ale. Sometime I devote a
25% or more of the entire ad to cloing.


Thi, of coure, ha been jut a few “tarter idea” on how to create
a DM promotion. A I keep aying, I’m jut warming up and will get
more detailed later.


In the next couple day or o, I intend to end you Eric’ ale letter
and I want you to read it and then ee if you can ee how everything
I taught you in the lat few day would make hi letter more
effective.


But, in the meantime, I have an aignment for you. 


Here’ what I want you to do what I want you to do i get a copy of
the facelift ad and then it down and copy it in your own
handwriting. I want you to write it out jut the way you would if you
were going to take it to a ecretarial ervice to have it typed. By the
way, check with B on thi and he’ll tell you what format your hand
written copy hould be in.


And gue what? After you have completed thi aignment I will
explain why I am having you do thi and how it will help you.


I Love You And Good Luck!


Dad


.S. I heard you got your driver’ licene! I’m very proud of you!
