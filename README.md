### How to Write Irresistible Copy (Just Like Ben Franklin)

You have the potential to become a master at writing copy, just like learning a new musical instrument. With the right guidance, anyone can learn to write compelling copy. 

Introducing copywork - a proven discipline used to teach people how to write. For centuries, copywork has been the foundation of teaching children how to write well.

**Here's how it works: you copy, using your own handwriting, the work of other writers.** By doing so, you immerse yourself in the texture, pattern, and habits of great writing.

Just like learning a musical instrument, you don't start by composing your own songs. You start by learning and playing other people's songs. Once you have mastered and found your own style, you can develop your own voice using the patterns you noticed in copying others.

This is exactly how copywork can help you become a better writer.
